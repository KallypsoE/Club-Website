<h1>Art Classes at Mid City</h1>
<h2>2D Drawing</h2>
<img src="images/uni.jfif" alt="unicorn picture"class="fixme">
<p>In this paper-pencil only class you'll be learning how to draw from scratch. What that means is that it doesn't matter if you're
  the best drawer or the worst, you'll be learning from the very begnning. Some things you'll be learning how to do is knowing the spacing between body parts, how big a certain
  body parts should be, and how to properly draw lips and eyes. Another thing you'll have to do in this class is "personal drawings" and basically that just means every week you'll
  have to turn in 4 drawings/sketches that you did outside of class. The projects you'll be doing in this class includes:</p>

      <li>One Point Perspective</li>
      <li>Human Body Drawing</li>

  <h2>Photography</h2>
  <img src="images/camera.png" alt="camera" height="180px" width="300px" class="fixme">
  <p>In Photography class you probably think you'll just learn how to use a camera and take random pictures. While that's not completely wrong, you'll also be learning how to use paint.net, which is
    basically what you use before learning how to use photoshop. you'll also be learning the differnet photography styles and different types of photography. Some projects that you'll be doing is:</p>
    <div class="center">
      <ul>
      <li>Portaits</li>
      <li>Elments of Photography and Design</li>
      <li>Digital portfolio</li>
    </ul>
    </div>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
  <h2>Sculpture</h2>
  <img src="images/C.jfif" alt="sculpture" class="fixme">
  <p>I'm sure when you hear "sculpture" you think of different things, which is what you're going to be doing. Your sculpture maybe made of clay, paper mache, metal, or just about anything really.
    Of course in a class with different units, you'll be doing different projects. Some that'll be done in this class would include:</p>
  <div class="center">
    <ul>
      <li>Freestanding</li>
      <li>Base Relief</li>
      <li>Installatoins</li>
    </ul>
</div>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
  <h2>Art Foundation</h2>
  <img src="images/classroom.jfif" alt="classroom" class="fixme">
  <p>With this mixed media class you'll be learning basically a little bit of everything there is in art. From abstract painting and sculptures to macrame to clayworks. You'll also be learing the history
    of the things you work on. Not every class will work on the smae things which I suppose is what makes it more interesting. You don't have to take this class before all the others, but it would help since
    you're going to be learning a bit about the rest of the other classes. In this class you'll be doing all sorts of projects, some of which include:</p>
    <div class="center">
      <ul>
        <li>Art Foundation</li>
        <li>Drawing</li>
        <li>Painting</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
  <h2>Art portfolio</h2>
  <img src="images/book.jfif" alt="Books" class="fixme">
  <p>I'm sure just by reading the title you can already tell what you'll be learning in this class. However, incase you still don't have a clue, in Art portfolio you'll be learning how to create a
    portfolio for all your art and that includes: 2D Drawing, Photography and the rest of classes listed above. Assuming you already have art work, this class would be amung the most useful, espically
    is you're trying to get a job that's artisic or if you're trying to get into an art school/go to school for art. In this class, some of the projects that you'll be doing will include:</p>
    <div class="center">
      <ul>
        <li>Digital portfolio</li>
        <li>Concentration and Breathe</li>
        <li>Websites</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
